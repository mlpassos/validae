# Validae

Validae is a small Code Igniter Web Application that scans for all the pages in a website and validates then all / per page.

It uses html_simple_dom library to fetch all the links in a website and then shows validations options for the links on the 
same domain.

Validae is being developed to validate my own sites, but if you feel you want to contribute, be my guest and make a pull request.

Current features:

- Scans for all pages in the website domain 
- Show all pages with individual options for validation
- Show Messages about each page individually
- Show Messages for all (validate all)

Todo list:

- Refactor JS code to the Module Pattern
- Implement EventEmitter for Messaging between modules
- Cache

That's all folks.

Cheers from Brazil!
